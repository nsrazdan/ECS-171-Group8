\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Overview}
The project aims to use supervised learning techniques to build a Machine Learning model that predicts the "virality", which is defined as a view count, of a video. Predicting whether the video is trending or non-trending is a binary classification problem; thus, we implemented Neural Network and Logistic Regression model, compared the performance of the two models, and chose the best model in order to classify the video given some data about it. Besides Machine Learning model, we developed a web application to show how the model works.
