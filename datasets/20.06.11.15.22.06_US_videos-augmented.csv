Find out how what this colossus lacks in subtlety it makes up for in potential thanks to its rapid SSD and remarkable new DualSense controller.The IGN PS5 review will cover our first impressions of the PS5 console, the new PS5 UI, the PS5 controller—better known as the DualSense controller—and much much more.The PlayStation 5 console is easily one of the largest consoles ever, and you can’t really appreciate its size until you see it in person. Our review highlights our PS5 hands-on impressions, including the console’s look and feel in the flesh as well as potential ways it could fit in your home entertainment setup. The PlayStation 5 user interface (PS5 UI) will also be thoroughly discussed in the video and will highlight new navigation features like “cards.”While the video does have PS5 gameplay footage from Spider-Man Miles Morales, it’s merely used to talk about how the PS5 specs and PS5 SSD are going to revolutionize loading in next-gen games.Finally, the review will touch on the new DualSense controller.

And how will Boba Fett help the Mandalorian trace Baby Yoda to his origin and connect everyone to the Jedi?New Rockstars supports efforts to end racial violence.

As it has for all of us this global pandemic has flipped our world upside down.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. Halting our dream of driving around the world was a hard pill to swallow which is why we knew we needed a big project to keep our mind + body busy while social distancing back here in Toronto. Enter building an off-grid tiny house on wheels!! But after nearly 6 months, we realized that our dreams of continuing van life across North America in our new van build were not a current reality with the state of the world. So, we've found ourselves pursuing something we've dreamed of since we first got together 8 years ago... a cabin in the woods 😊 Tour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:VAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels http://bit.ly/newvantourWhat's in Our Camera Bag? https://www.eamonandbec.com/blogWho are we?We're Eamon and Bec, a Toronto-based couple who live full-time in our self converted Sprinter Van!!

We start with Mando on Nevarro 7, I think, as he walks through a grungy spray painted place, now on the walls there’s tons of cool stuff. We see a BX-Battle Droid, what looks like Vader, we see Grievous, We se snow troopers, what looks like c-3PO but what could be a CZ3 droid, but even that I don’t think it is. Right here we see Chewie and the giant worm thing, there we see Vader, honestly I could keep going on these spray painted walls which I might in another video, but for now, let’s move on. Wampa, Watto, maybe.Mando has a run in with Gor Koresh at this gladiator style event where Gamorreans fight each other, they’re actually slaves with owners. Got Karesh plays it like he’ll tell Mando where to find more Mandos so that Baby Yoda can be reunited with its kind, until he turns on him and a brawl breaks out. Some Zabraks fight Mando, who were the species Maul was, until Mando pulls out his vibro blade which I’ve done a full video on by itself.Mando takes em down and leaves Gor Karesh to be eaten by some Hounds, Flying to Tatooine, he meets up with Cobb Vanth, who is wearing Boba Fett's armor. How could this be? Boba Fett died to the Sarlacc in Return of the Jedi, right? Could he be alive, still?Mando and Cobb team up with Tusken Raiders to take down the Krayt Dragon and in doing so, Cobb vows to give Mando the Boba armor. The Dragon is defeated, and the Tuskens find a pearl within the Dragon. This was directly taken out of KOTOR.As The Mandalorian and Baby Yoda speed into the twin suns of Tatooine, a mysterious man is looming from afar, watching their every move...BOBA FETT!HE LIVES!
