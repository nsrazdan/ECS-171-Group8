Watch the trailer for the new #TomAndJerryMovie now – coming to theaters 2021.One of the most beloved rivalries in history is reignited when Jerry moves into New York City’s finest hotel on the eve of “the wedding of the century,” forcing the event’s desperate planner to hire Tom to get rid of him, in director Tim Story’s “Tom & Jerry.”  The ensuing cat and mouse battle threatens to destroy her career, the wedding and possibly the hotel itself. But soon, an even bigger problem arises: a diabolically ambitious staffer conspiring against all three of them. An eye-popping blend of classic animation and live action, Tom and Jerry’s new big-screen adventure stakes new ground for the iconic characters and forces them to do the unthinkable… work together to save the day.    “Tom & Jerry” stars Chloë Grace Moretz (“Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising,” “The Addams Family”), Michael Peña (“Cesar Chavez,” “American Hustle,” “Ant-Man”), Rob Delaney (“Deadpool 2,” “Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw”), Colin Jost (“How to be Single,” “Saturday Night Live”), and Ken Jeong (“Crazy Rich Asians,” “The Hangover,” “Transformers: Dark of the Moon”).  The film is directed by Tim Story (“Fantastic Four,” “Think Like a Man,” “Barbershop”) and produced by Chris DeFaria (“The LEGO Movie 2,” “Ready Player One,” “Gravity”).  It is written by Kevin Costello, based on characters created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.  Serving as executive producers are Tim Story, Adam Goodman, Steven Harding, Sam Register, Jesse Ehrman, and Allison Abbate. The creative filmmaking team includes director of photography Alan Stewart, production designer James Hambidge, editor Peter S. Elliot, and costume designer Alison McCosh.  The music is composed by Christopher Lennertz.  A Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Animation Group presentation, a Tim Story Film, “Tom & Jerry” will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film is rated PG for cartoon violence, rude humor and brief language."

Subaru has also given the BRZ a new design inside and out and when it goes on sale next Fall, pricing shouldn't stray too far from the current models under $30k base price."

His work spans decades and it took multiple tries to understand it in a way that could be put together in a narrative. I am very grateful for all of his time, warmth and generosity. I had to leave many, many wonderful pieces of research and factoids out due to time constraints but I would urge any of you that are interested to dive deeper into his work. His colleagues Dr. William G. Ryerson, Ms. Amanda E. Hewes andMs. Sara Horwitz contributed a great deal to some of the research that I mentioned.Dr. Margaret Rubega (https://rubegalab.uconn.edu/) deserves thanks for introducing me to Kurt in the first place.Additional footage licensed from:Pond5.comEnvato ElementsVideoblocks.comShutterstock.com"

Today I am doing a video that was honestly DEMANDED by some people in my comment sections recently 😂 Many of you really wanted to see my attempt to Fix The Unfixable, sooooo, here I go. This special episode of squishy makeovers will be me attempting to fix and redecorate squishies from the WORST or worst. These extremely damaged squishies come from my hopeless bin and I was honestly not sure if they would ever make it out!Also, I am aware that this whole spamming of my comment setions kind of started a war between those who were doing it and those who thought it was really annoying 😂 I appreciate those of you who didn't want me to be pressured into doing a video I didn't want to do! Don't worry, I'm happy to give it a try. And I appreciate getting video requests from you guys.DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE COUSIN DERP PLUSH!https://moriahelizabethmerch.com/AND The new Christmas apparel design is now available here:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/listing/special-holiday-collection?product=345_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).

We've always envisioned moving into the woods by the lake and building our dream tiny cabin as a home base for us to come back to in between our international travels. We cannot wait to have a place to call our own!! After 4 weeks up here we are really settling into the slow pace of life and the peace and quiet. And this week we tackle two projects that CHANGE EVERYTHING for us up here!!! 🌲  Looking forward to all of the home renovations and cabin improvements we'll be tackling this winter!Catch up on our cabin in the woods videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZJRuafNYdPweo6S8x6hvPZowmbLrkFM7Eamon & Bec Products↠ handmade chai blends https://chaiwalachai.com/ ↞↠ cookbook https://www.eamonandbec.com/weekday-whip-ups ↞↠ professional photo filters https://www.eamonandbec.com/presets ↞↠ van build guide https://www.eamonandbec.com/vanbuild ↞How Did We Get Here?Abandoning our Van in Africa  https://bit.ly/2Kff0HTAfter an incredible 3 years of living, working, and traveling in our self converted Sprinter Van we made the very tough decision to abandon it in Africa to take a rescue flight back to Canada.  As it has for all of us this global pandemic has flipped our world upside down.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. Halting our dream of driving around the world was a hard pill to swallow which is why we knew we needed a big project to keep our mind + body busy while social distancing back here in Toronto. Enter building an off-grid tiny house on wheels!! But after nearly 6 months, we realized that our dreams of continuing van life across North America in our new van build were not a current reality with the state of the world. So, we've found ourselves pursuing something we've dreamed of since we first got together 8 years ago... a cabin in the woods 😊 Tour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:VAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels http://bit.ly/newvantourWhat's in Our Camera Bag? https://www.eamonandbec.com/blogWho are we?We're Eamon and Bec, a Toronto-based couple who live full-time in our self converted Sprinter Van!!

Our goal here is to inspire you to chase after your own dreams however big (or small... tiny homes anyone?) they may be! We hope to create a community of like-minded, positive individuals who will grow to love and support one another on their own journeys."

Not only a trailblazer for Native American dancers, Tallchief is widely considered one of the country’s most influential ballerinas of all time. On this day in 2007, a bronze sculpture of Tallchief and four other Native American ballerinas was unveiled in Oklahoma at the Tulsa Historical Society in a piece titled “The Five Moons” by artist Gary Henson.

There were tons of important things in this episode that I hope to breakdown with you.Something super important to mention is that Bo says Din Djarin is a child of the watch, children of the watch are a cult of religious zealots who broke away from mandalorian society, their goal is to re-establish the ancient way she’s talking about death watch who were the ones who saved him as a kid.Death watch were hellbent on making Mandalore what it once was, they were very purist and elitist and led by Pre Vizsla  during the Clone Wars who died to Darth Maul in trial by combat. Maul had the dark sober and Bo Katan and the other members of clan Kryze were pushed out.She says that Mandalorians are stronger when together, and he says it’s not part of his plan, as he’s been quested to bringing this child to the Jedi. Bo says she knows of one she can introduce him to, if he helps them with their mission (Ahsoka Tano).We see an awesome few minutes of pure action where the 4 Mandalorians make stormtroopers look like…well…stormtroopers.Now in regards to the Dark Saber for those who need a quick recap -  The dark saber is basically the Key to uniting Mandalore and the Mandalorian people. Think of the Dark Saber as a key to the planet. Whoever possesses it, rules Mandalore. The only way to take it, is to kill the possessor of the blade, or challenge them to a trial by combat, like Maul did to Pre Viszla. So it makes me wonder how Giddeon did it to Bo, did he take it from her, if so then how is she alive? At the end of Rebels, Sabine gave the saber to Bo to take back Mandalore under her rule, so the gap has yet to be filled in. As they move their way up to the bridge, Moff Gideon talks to the captain via holo, where he learns that it’s the Mandalorians who have attacked the Empire’s other vessels, calling them, pirates.I'm excited to know what Ahsoka Tano is up to. Has she had any kind of communication with Anakin Skywalker in the force now that he's a ghost again?Become a Patron to support future content - https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheoryJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join#TheMandalorian #StarWars #Ahsoka #BoKatan"
