The septet‚Äîcomposed of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook‚Äîco-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.After debuting in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark & Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings, was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the global music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records.",2013-12-23T20:47:31Z,

It had proven that they are growing as a global influence with 8 albums entering into the Billboard along with ‚ÄòArtist 100‚Äô  On the third day of the album's release, it broke its record including ranking number one in 49 countries on the iTunes Album Chart, ranking number one worldwide for three consecutive days, and also entering the ‚ÄòRolling Stone Top 200‚Äô Chart for two consecutive weeks, as well as entering the Top 100 on the Official Album Download Chart, which is an official chart in the UK. After successfully completing the promotions of ‚ÄúWhy Not?‚Äù which is the title track of [12:00] album, LOONA released the official music video and concept photos of Star, the English version of Voice in response to the support they receive globally.  Even though Voice and Star are the same songs, Korean version and the English version consist of lyrics of two different stories and charms. Star is an energetic retro song with a low, addictive repeated beat. Inspired by the Midnight Festival, Sleeping Beauty, and space, ‚ÄúStar‚Äù music video tells the story of waking up in a dream and pursuing goals and inspiration after discovering themselves in a mysterious space. The stars that appear throughout the music video represents ‚ÄòOrbits‚Äô, LOONA‚Äôs official fan club, indicating that LOONA is chasing their dream in the spotlight by Orbits from all over the world.#Ïù¥Îã¨ÏùòÏÜåÎÖÄ #LOONA #Midnight #MV #BlockBerry #BlockBerryCreativeMore about LOOŒ†Œî/LOOŒ†Œî Official : http://www.loonatheworld.comLOOŒ†Œî Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/loonatheworld/LOOŒ†Œî Twitter : https://twitter.com/loonatheworldLOOŒ†Œî Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/loonatheworld/LOOŒ†Œî Official Korean Fan Cafe : http://cafe.daum.net/loonatheworldCopyrights 2020 ‚ìí BlockBerryCreative.

Today I am doing a video that was honestly DEMANDED by some people in my comment sections recently üòÇ Many of you really wanted to see my attempt to Fix The Unfixable, sooooo, here I go. This special episode of squishy makeovers will be me attempting to fix and redecorate squishies from the WORST or worst. These extremely damaged squishies come from my hopeless bin and I was honestly not sure if they would ever make it out!Also, I am aware that this whole spamming of my comment setions kind of started a war between those who were doing it and those who thought it was really annoying üòÇ I appreciate those of you who didn't want me to be pressured into doing a video I didn't want to do! Don't worry, I'm happy to give it a try. And I appreciate getting video requests from you guys.DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE COUSIN DERP PLUSH!https://moriahelizabethmerch.com/AND The new Christmas apparel design is now available here:https://moriah-elizabeth.teespring.com/listing/special-holiday-collection?product=345_________FAQs__________1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?So many generous people have sent me their unwanted squishies so I actually have a lot to work on already, BUT if you desperately want to, you can request my mailing address in the email ALLLL the way at down in the description (sorry for the traveling), make sure to read the disclaimer down there as well.2. ARE SQUISHIES RETURNED TO THE SENDERS AFTER THE MAKEOVER?No. These squishies  are sent as donations to the series because they were damaged, and no longer wanted. Everyone has been informed in advance that squishies would not be returned. It would be waaay too complicated/expensive and massively time consuming to keep track of everyone and return each squishy. I'm just one person! 3. WHAT PAINT DO YOU USE?I use fabric paint. Fabric paint is meant to stretch, so it is perfect for squishing! Any brand will work fine, but I mainly use Tulip. You can find it at Michaels, Hobby Lobby, A.C. Moore, Walmart, Joann Fabrics, and Online.5. WILL FABRIC PAINT CRACK?The matte fabric paint is more likely to crack after lots of squishing. Slick fabric paints never crack. But there are benefits to both. I usually mix the two paints together to get the best of both worlds.___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

As it has for all of us this global pandemic has flipped our world upside down.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. Halting our dream of driving around the world was a hard pill to swallow which is why we knew we needed a big project to keep our mind + body busy while social distancing back here in Toronto. Enter building an off-grid tiny house on wheels!! But after nearly 6 months, we realized that our dreams of continuing van life across North America in our new van build were not a current reality with the state of the world. So, we've found ourselves pursuing something we've dreamed of since we first got together 8 years ago... a cabin in the woods üòä Tour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:VAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels http://bit.ly/newvantourWhat's in Our Camera Bag? https://www.eamonandbec.com/blogWho are we?We're Eamon and Bec, a Toronto-based couple who live full-time in our self converted Sprinter Van!!
