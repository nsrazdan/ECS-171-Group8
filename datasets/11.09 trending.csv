A big thank you to Honey for sponsoring today's video!Hello friends! Today, I return to the land of internet hauls and social media targeted recommendations - with a deep dive into the Instagram shop tab! Previously, I have bought things recommended to me via targeted ads on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat - and when the shop tab was rolled out - peeking its lil head out from behind the explore page - I was instantly intrigued. So I spent an evening perusing the shop tab, finding 3 different common themes of what Instagram wanted me to buy, and then purchasing those things, and trying them out. It was a WILD ride, as Instagram recommended me everything from full-on historical costumes to trendy e-girl fashion. Which outfit was your favorite?

Mr Biden has won more than 73 million votes so far, the most ever for a US presidential candidate.

This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes “gimmicky” golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment.

Codeine and morphine can be glucuronidated in a second pass of metabolism, but watch for renal function in hospitalized patients as morphine-6-glucuronide is renally excreted. Because it is pharmacologically active as an analgesic as well, use caution in patients with renal failure. Genetic mutations in 2D6 have been observed and result in different pharmacokinetics for codeine. See references below.This case is 2 cases combined. Both are de-identified.

And why is Boba Fett no longer wearing his armor -- did he lose the armor, did he voluntarily sell it, or some other explanation? Erik Voss breaks down the big twist from last week’s new episode of The Mandalorian that now everyone has been openly discussing and debating: Boba Fett’s mysterious return and future role in upcoming episodes of The Mandalorian Season 2. What subtle clues throughout The Mandalorian point to the story behind Boba Fett’s survival and loss of his armor? What is Boba Fett’s relationship with the Tusken Raiders? And how will Boba Fett help the Mandalorian trace Baby Yoda to his origin and connect everyone to the Jedi?New Rockstars supports efforts to end racial violence.

As it has for all of us this global pandemic has flipped our world upside down.  When our Prime Minister announced that he was sending repatriation flights over to Africa to pick up Canadians who were stuck (due to border closures) we consulted with friends and family closest to us and realized that in this time of crisis we should be back in our home country. Halting our dream of driving around the world was a hard pill to swallow which is why we knew we needed a big project to keep our mind + body busy while social distancing back here in Toronto. Enter building an off-grid tiny house on wheels!! But after nearly 6 months, we realized that our dreams of continuing van life across North America in our new van build were not a current reality with the state of the world. So, we've found ourselves pursuing something we've dreamed of since we first got together 8 years ago... a cabin in the woods 😊 Tour the renovations we've done to our self converted sprinter van:VAN TOUR after 2 years living in our TINY HOUSE on wheels http://bit.ly/newvantourWhat's in Our Camera Bag? https://www.eamonandbec.com/blogWho are we?We're Eamon and Bec, a Toronto-based couple who live full-time in our self converted Sprinter Van!!
