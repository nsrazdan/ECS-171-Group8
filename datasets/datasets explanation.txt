"11.09 trending" and "11.09 nontrending" are together our primary dataset. Based on our discussion 
today, we'll be updating these each day with the most recent viewcount, likes, dislikes and comment 
count, along with a timestamp of the most recent update. For now I decided to just keep the file
names the same for the updated files and remove the old files, but if that doesn't work we can talk
about how to name them. 

In order to determine whether any of the nontrending videos start to trend, we also have to get the 
current set of trending videos each day. "11.09.06 trending" is the first of these. The next should
be "11.10 trending", then "11.11 trending" and so on. 

"11.18 recent" is a database of videos gathered over the last 24 hours, which should be better for
tracking changes in subscriber count and other attributes. "11.16 recent" was the first attempt
at this which got messed up.
